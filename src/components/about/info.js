              <Description>
                Although diversity efforts are a large talking point in society today, diversity in
                STEM continues to decrease. Weâ€™re addressing these issues at their roots by bringing
                together like-minded students across the entire tri-state, especially those
                marginalized and disadvantaged, through hackathons, competitions, weekly meetings,
                and other advantageous events designed by our team.
